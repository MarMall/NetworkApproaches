# Lab - Part PREP - Network Data Collection via Surveys

## Lab requirements

You need to have R (preferably a recent version) installed on a Linux, Windows or MacOS PC.
You should have connected to [Qualtrics via the RUG-MyUniversity access](https://rug.eu.qualtrics.com/).

## What this lab will teach you

We want to teach you a couple of things in this lab

- How to think about integrated data collection
    - i.e. network-specific data (relations)
    - with individual-specific data (attributes)

- How to implement this in a streamlined Qualtrics and R workflow
    - by first designing a survey in Qualtrics
    - collecting the data
    - importing the data into R

- Doing exploratory network analysis in R
    - processing and exploring the data in a network-specific R-package such as **igraph**
    
## Where this module fits into the overall course

- modules so far have taught you...
    - how networks can play a role in a diversity of mixed-methods research approaches in the form of...
        - textual data (documents' relations and narratives as networks)
        - economic data (business ties and kinship ties)

- this module aims to give you an idea of...
    - how to implement your research ideas into a network-oriented data collection 
    - how to connect your data to network analysis workflows in R
    - how via network data visualisation you can show that more research into specific patterns is warranted
    

## Objectives

This lab is divided into three sub-sections (for better orientability), and in the separate sub-modules you will:

+ Task 1: Implement your research plan (and hypothesis into a Qualtrics survey) - Lab 20-2-A
+ Task 2: Import the collected data into R - Lab 20-2-B
+ Task 3: Carry out exploratory network analysis in R - Lab 20-2-C

(NB: Tasks 1 and 2 should be carried out as preparatory work before the lab session as far as possible, and task 3 will be carried out during the lab session)

## Estimated timing for all three lab session: ~120 minutes


## Moving on to first sub-lab 20-2-A

Please move on to the first [sub-lab 20-2-A](LAB_20-2-A-ImplementResearchPlan_intoQualtrics.md), where you will implement your research plan into a Qualtrics survey.
